## Hi there 👋

I'm Rui Wu, a sophomore student of Computer Science Department at Rutgers University.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning LLM/AI4Sci/GraphLearning.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on research about AI4Sci.
- 📫 My personal website: [here](https://iamb3st.github.io/)



Here are some useful guidance for exploring my repo:

- 🥰 I keep a [repo](https://github.com/IamB3ST/MyCourses) to record the courses I have had each semester at Rutgers.
- 😍 I always update some useful papers I have readed [here](https://github.com/IamB3ST/PaperReading).
- 😘 Follow my [way](https://github.com/IamB3ST/LearningDL) to study deep learning and LLM if you want!
