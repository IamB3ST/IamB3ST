## Hi there 👋

I'm Rui Wu, a sophomore student of Computer Science Department at Rutgers University.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning LLMs/MLLMs/Trustworthy.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on research about MLLM.
- 📫 My personal [website](https://iamb3st.github.io/).



Here are some useful guidance for exploring my repo:

- 😍 Follow my [way](https://github.com/IamB3ST/LearningDL) to study deep learning and LLM if you want!
- 😘 I sometimes update useful papers about LLMs/MLLMs/Trustworthy I have readed [here](https://github.com/IamB3ST/PaperReading).
